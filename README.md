# On the Limits of Pseudo Ground Truth in Visual Camera Re-Localization

## Code
Coming soon-ish.

## Structure-from-Motion pseudo GT for 7 Scenes and 12 Scenes
The [Colmap](https://colmap.github.io/index.html) 3D models of the [7 Scenes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/rgb-d-dataset-7-scenes/) and [12 Scenes](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/reloc/) datasets used in the paper are available here:
* [7 Scenes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ATijcGCgK84NKB4Mho4_T-P7x8LSL80m/view?usp=sharing)
* [12 Scenes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u5du-cYp3J3-BfybZVkhvgv0PPua8tud/view?usp=sharing)
Since the 3D models are derived from the original datasets, they are released under the same licences as the 7 Scenes and 12 Scenes datasets. 
Before using the datasets, please check the licenses (see the websites of the datasets or the README.md files that come with the 3D models). 
Note that the Google Drive folder that currently hosts the data has a daily download limit. We are currently looking into alternative hosting options.
